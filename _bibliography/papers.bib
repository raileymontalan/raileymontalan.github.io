    abstract = "Supervised learning approaches in NLP, exemplified by POS tagging, rely heavily on the presence of large amounts of annotated data. However, acquiring such data often requires significant amount of resources and incurs high costs. In this work, we explore zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning to address data scarcity issues in Filipino POS tagging, particularly focusing on optimizing source language selection. Our zero-shot approach demonstrates superior performance compared to previous studies, with top-performing fine-tuned PLMs achieving F1 scores as high as 79.10{\%}. The analysis reveals moderate correlations between cross-lingual transfer performance and specific linguistic distances{--}featural, inventory, and syntactic{--}suggesting that source languages with these features closer to Filipino provide better results. We identify tokenizer optimization as a key challenge, as PLM tokenization sometimes fails to align with meaningful representations, thus hindering POS tagging performance.",

    abstract = "Southeast Asia (SEA) is a region rich in linguistic diversity and cultural variety, with over 1,300 indigenous languages and a population of 671 million people. However, prevailing AI models suffer from a significant lack of representation of texts, images, and audio datasets from SEA, compromising the quality of AI models for SEA languages. Evaluating models for SEA languages is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, compounded by the dominance of English training data, raising concerns about potential cultural misrepresentation. To address these challenges, through a collaborative movement, we introduce SEACrowd, a comprehensive resource center that fills the resource gap by providing standardized corpora in nearly 1,000 SEA languages across three modalities. Through our SEACrowd benchmarks, we assess the quality of AI models on 36 indigenous languages across 13 tasks, offering valuable insights into the current AI landscape in SEA. Furthermore, we propose strategies to facilitate greater AI advancements, maximizing potential utility and resource equity for the future of AI in Southeast Asia.",

We introduce KALAHI, a cultural LLM evaluation suite that is part of SEA-HELM. It was collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers, and is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in KALAHI indicates a modelâ€™s ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that KALAHI, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, KALAHI can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.",

    abstract = "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on widely benchmarked high-resource languages. However, linguistic nuances of under-resourced languages remain unexplored. We introduce Batayan, a holistic Filipino benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs across three key natural language processing (NLP) competencies: understanding, reasoning, and generation. Batayan consolidates eight tasks, three of which have not existed prior for Filipino corpora, covering both Tagalog and code-switched Taglish utterances. Our rigorous, native-speaker-driven adaptation and validation processes ensures fluency and authenticity to the complex morphological and syntactic structures of Filipino, alleviating the pervasive translationese bias in existing Filipino corpora. We report empirical results on a variety of open-source and commercial LLMs, highlighting significant performance gaps that signal the under-representation of Filipino in pre-training corpora, the unique hurdles in modeling Filipino{'}s rich morphology and construction, and the importance of explicit Filipino language support. Moreover, we discuss the practical challenges encountered in dataset construction and propose principled solutions for building culturally and linguistically-faithful resources in under-represented languages. We also provide a public evaluation suite as a clear foundation for iterative, community-driven progress in Filipino NLP.",

Combination of data coming from various sources that report historical disease incidences and transportation infrastructures are valuable sources of knowledge that can assist in public health policies and initiatives surrounding disease surveillance. This study integrates population, disease incidence, and transportation network data into measles modeling. Results show that a hybrid metapopulation modeling approach using ideal flow distribution over mobility networks can yield more accurate models for measles progression. This demonstrates the feasibility of using big data in the monitoring of measles propagation.},
